TODOS: 

    PRIO:
        - test in arena with shared cds, same class meaning 2x...
        - Shared cds dissapears for target/focus tracked units when re targeting, maybe store shared cds in the cb cache?
        - add spec property to TalentTreeCoordinates.lua

    2) Update unit aura detection in world if I want to have that there. If so need to update OnPlayerTargetChanged, OnUnitAura, SpecDetection
    3) Remove showing items for hostile players, keep party members as is. Since its impossible to know what trinkets is equpped, better to hide until used.
    4) Add shared cds and reset cds logic, WIP
