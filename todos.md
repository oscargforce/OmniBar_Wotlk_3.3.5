    Before Merge Branch:
    - Add sorting to focus
    - Add sorting to target

    Side quest:
    1) Improve the current solution for sorting of arena1,2,3. If the user reloads mid game, the icons would dissapear.
    2) Fix the toggling of anchor.
    3) Reset the state of partyGUID after leaving arena,
    4) Improve the reset icons after combat timer. If player is in dungeon we should not reset the icons :)
